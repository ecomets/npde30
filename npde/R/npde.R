#' Pharmacokinetics of theophylline
#'
#' The \code{theopp} data frame has 132 rows and 5 columns of data from an
#' experiment on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline.
#'
#' Boeckmann, Sheiner and Beal (1994) report data from a study by Dr. Robert
#' Upton of the kinetics of the anti-asthmatic drug theophylline.  Twelve
#' subjects were given oral doses of theophylline then serum concentrations
#' were measured at 11 time points over the next 25 hours.
#'
#' These data are analyzed in Davidian and Giltinan (1995) and Pinheiro and
#' Bates (2000) using a two-compartment open pharmacokinetic model.
#'
#' These data are also available in the library \code{datasets} under the name
#' \code{Theoph} in a slightly modified format and including the data at time
#' 0.  Here, we use the file in the format provided in the \emph{NONMEM}

#' Simulated data for the computation of normalised prediction distribution
#' errors in the theophylline dataset
#'
#' The \code{simtheopp} dataset contains 100 simulations using the design of
#' dataset \code{\link{theopp}}. These simulations are used to compute npde.
#' The control file used to perform the simulations can be found in the
#' subdirectory 'doc' within the library npde.
#'
#' See \code{\link{theopp}} for a description of the original dataset.
#'
#' The simulated data was obtained using the software \emph{NONMEM}. A
#' one-compartment model was fit to the data. An exponential interindividual
#' variability was assumed for the three parameters (absorption rate constant
#' ka, volume of distribution V and clearance CL) and a combined additive and
#' proportional residual error model was usd. The estimated parameters were
#' then used to simulate 100 datasets with the same structure as the original
#' dataset.  Thus, for each observation in the original dataset, the simulated
#' dataset contains 100 simulations under the model used for the estimation.
#'
#' This dataset is provided so that users can figure out what type of data is
#' needed for the computation of prediction distribution errors. More
#' information can be found in the User Guide distributed along with this
#' package, which contains a run-through of the theophylline example.

#' Pharmacokinetics of warfarin
#'
#' The \code{warfarin} data frame has 251 rows and 8 columns of data containing
#' data on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, an anticoagulant drug used in the 
#' prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism.
#' 
#' The dataset is the PK part of a larger dataset including both warfarin concentrations
#' and prothrombin complex activity (PCA), which measures the decreased coagulation 
#' activity resulting from the inhibition of vitamin K recycling, the mechanism of 
#' action of warfarin. It contains the concentrations measured in 32 healthy subjects 
#' after a single oral dose of warfarin sodium (1.5 mg/kg of body weight). The subjects 
#' in the study were sampled at different times over a period of up to 120 hours.
#' 
#' The data is distributed with the Monolix software as a demo for PK/PD modelling.
#' The data has been slightly reformated for R, removing the line at time=0
#' and filling the amt column with the dose for each subject, following the output
#' of simulx which was used to simulate data from two alternative models to fit this
#' dataset.
#' 
#' Two datasets containing simulated data are associated with the \code{warfarin} data. For
#' each dataset, 1000 simulations of the original data were performed.
#' \describe{
#' \item{simwarfarinBase}{the data in this dataset was simulated according to a base model without covariates: the PK model was a two-compartment model, with first-order absorption and a time-delay. Interindividual variability was modelled as log-normal distributions for parameters Tlag, ka, Cl and V1, and the error model was a combined error model. The parameters were estimated by Monolix.}
#' \item{simwarfarinCov}{the data in this dataset was simulated according to a model including several covariates: an age (centered on 30 yr) effect on Cl, a weight (centered on 70 kg) effect on Cl and V1, and a gender effect on V1. The covariate model was built in Monolix.}
